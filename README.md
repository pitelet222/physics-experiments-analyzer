Physics Experiments Analyzer

Physics Experiments Analyzer is a Python toolkit designed to simplify the analysis and visualization of data from a wide variety of physics experiments. It helps researchers, students, and hobbyists extract meaningful insights quickly and efficiently.

Features:

•  Experimental Data Analysis: Easily process and analyze data from multiple types of physics experiments.
•	 Data Visualization: Generate clear, informative, and interactive graphs to better understand your results.
•  Flexible Data Support: Import data from common formats such as CSV, TXT, and more.
•  Extensible: Designed to be easily extended with new analysis methods and visualization tools.

Installation:

Follow these steps to get started:
	1.	Clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/pitelet222/physics-experiments-analyzer.git
	cd physics-experiments-analyzer

2.	Create a virtual environment (recommended):

		python -m venv venv
		source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

	
3.	Install dependencies:

		pip install -r requirements.txt

	
4.	Run the project:

		python main.py

Example Usage:

from experiments import Experimento

# Create an experiment instance
	exp = Experimento('path/to/data.csv')

# Analyze the data
	exp.analizar()

# Visualize the results
	exp.visualizar()

This example loads data from a CSV file, performs the analysis, and displays the results in graphs.
